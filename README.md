                              TechBook

TechBook is a FaceBook style forum. Connect with friends, join groups, make groups, ask questions and get answers from your peers. Even vote for your favorite posts. So what are you waiting for? Make an account and start browsing the forum. This is just the Minimum Viable Product. There is much more to come. For some reason the screen shots are purple. I could not achieve the correct color with my screen shots. I assure you it is not purple.
